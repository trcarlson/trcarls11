... This will probably fall out of data extremely fast and I know I will forget to update. 
If you wish to contact me for any reason, send an email to trcarlson11@gmail.com with an attention-grabbing subject (or else I may disregard as junk). In the meantime I will be busy taking over the game - peace out y'all ‚úåüèΩ.
